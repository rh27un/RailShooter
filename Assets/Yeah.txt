Set number of lives (say 3)
Chosen number of Continues (Say, choose between infinite, 10, 3, and none)
When you die, you lose a life, and after a few seconds respawn at a set point. No progress is lost.
When you run out of lives, you lose a continue, and progress is reset to the last checkpoint.
When you run out of continues, the game is over and you must restart from the beginning.

Modern mode gives you 0 lives but infinite continues, essentially working as a regular checkpoint system
